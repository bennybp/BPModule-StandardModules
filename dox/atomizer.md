========

This fragmenter takes a system and breaks it into systems comprised of single
atoms.  In other words, given a molecule with \f$N\f$ atoms the result of
applying this system fragmenter will be \f$N\f$ systems with one atom each.

## General Features

- Atom serial numbers will map to the order in the system, i.e. the first atom
  is 0, the second is 1, etc.
- No recognized options
